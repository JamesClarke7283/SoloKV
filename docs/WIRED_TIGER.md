# Information About Wired Tiger

WiredTiger is a high-performance, scalable, transactional, and production-quality storage engine that has become the default storage engine for MongoDB since version 3.2. Here's an overview of its key design principles and implementation details:

1. Multi-CPU Scalability:
   WiredTiger is designed to scale effectively on modern multi-CPU architectures. It employs various programming techniques to maximize performance:
   - Hazard pointers
   - Lock-free algorithms
   - Fast latching
   - Message passing
   These techniques allow WiredTiger to perform more work per CPU core compared to alternative engines[2][4].

2. Concurrency Control:
   - Uses document-level concurrency control for write operations
   - Implements optimistic concurrency control for most read and write operations
   - Uses intent locks at global, database, and collection levels
   - Employs a conflict detection mechanism that triggers transparent retries when conflicts occur[1][2]

3. Transaction Management:
   WiredTiger uses optimistic concurrency control algorithms for transactions, avoiding the bottleneck of a centralized lock manager. This approach allows:
   - Transactional operations in one thread to not block operations in other threads
   - Strong isolation
   - Detection of update conflicts to preserve data consistency[2][4]

4. Storage Models:
   WiredTiger supports both:
   - Row-oriented storage: All columns of a row are stored together
   - Column-oriented storage: Groups of columns are stored in separate files
   This flexibility allows for more efficient memory use and enables mixing storage models at the table level[2][4].

5. Log-Structured Merge (LSM) Trees:
   WiredTiger supports LSM trees, which:
   - Buffer updates in small files that fit in cache for fast random updates
   - Automatically merge into larger files in the background
   - Create Bloom filters to avoid unnecessary reads from files that cannot contain matching keys[2][4]

6. B-Tree Optimizations:
   - Supports different-sized internal and leaf pages in the same file
   - Allows configuration of large leaf pages (up to 512MB) to maximize data transfer in each I/O
   - Minimizes CPU cache misses when searching the tree[2][4]

7. Compression Techniques:
   - Key prefix compression
   - Value dictionaries
   - Block compression on table pages (configurable per-table)
   - Journal compression (default: Snappy)
   These techniques significantly reduce memory usage and disk I/O[1][2][4].

8. Memory Management:
   - Uses both WiredTiger internal cache and filesystem cache
   - Default WiredTiger internal cache size is the larger of 50% of (RAM - 1 GB) or 256 MB
   - Uncompressed data in internal cache, compressed data in filesystem cache[1]

9. Journaling and Durability:
   - Implements write-ahead transaction logging
   - Journal persists all data modifications between checkpoints
   - Supports disabling journaling for performance at the cost of durability[1]

10. Variable-length Pages:
    WiredTiger supports variable-length pages, which:
    - Reduces wasted space for large objects
    - Eliminates the need for compaction as pages grow and shrink naturally[2][4]

11. Compact File Formats:
    - Does not store page content indexing information on disk
    - Instantiates content indexing information when pages are read or on-demand
    - Reduces on-disk overhead by 20-50% for small key/value pairs[2][4]

12. Data Integrity and Safety:
    - As a no-overwrite data engine, WiredTiger is safe from torn writes
    - Includes end-to-end checksums and verification support
    - Provides salvage support for data recovery in case of corruption[2]

13. Flexible Configuration:
    - Allows per-table configuration of compression algorithms
    - Supports mixing row-store and column-store formats at the table level[2][4]

14. Snapshot and Checkpoint Mechanism:
    WiredTiger uses a combination of snapshots and checkpoints to ensure data consistency and durability[1].

By incorporating these design principles and techniques, WiredTiger achieves high performance, scalability, and efficiency in both memory usage and disk I/O. These ideas can serve as inspiration for designing your own fast and memory-efficient key-value database engine.

WiredTiger is a high-performance, scalable storage engine that was originally developed as a standalone project and later acquired by MongoDB. It's now the default storage engine for MongoDB since version 3.2. Here's an overview of WiredTiger's key design aspects:

1. B+ Tree Structure:
   - Uses B+ trees for data organization, which allows for efficient range queries and inserts.
   - Implements a custom B+ tree variant optimized for modern hardware.

2. Document-Level Concurrency:
   - Provides document-level locking, allowing multiple threads to access different parts of the database simultaneously.

3. Multiversion Concurrency Control (MVCC):
   - Implements MVCC to allow consistent point-in-time reads without blocking writes.
   - Maintains multiple versions of data to support this.

4. Log-Structured Merge Trees (LSM):
   - Uses LSM trees for certain workloads, particularly useful for write-heavy scenarios.
   - Combines in-memory and on-disk components for efficient writes and compaction.

5. Compression:
   - Supports multiple compression algorithms including Snappy, zlib, and zstd.
   - Allows per-collection configuration of compression settings.

14. Adaptive Algorithms:
    - Uses adaptive algorithms for various operations, including compaction and cache management, to optimize performance based on workload.

15. Append-Only File Format:
    - Uses an append-only file format for data files, which simplifies certain aspects of concurrency and crash recovery.

16. Memory Footprint Optimization:
    - Designed to have a relatively small memory footprint, making efficient use of available system memory.

While WiredTiger is a complex system designed for high-performance database operations, you can draw inspiration from its design principles for SoloKV. Consider which aspects might be most relevant to your goals of simplicity and performance in a single-file key-value store. For instance, the B+ tree structure, efficient caching mechanisms, or the append-only file format could be particularly interesting for your project.
